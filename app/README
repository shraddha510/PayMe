Hello! This is Group 6's project for CS 3354, and we wanted to explain our GitHub repo.

We completed this project in Android Studio, so many of these files were auto-generated in our project folder.

The files that we worked on are:

-MainActivity
-User
-GroupMembersActivity
-GroupsActivity
-GroupListActivity
-activity_group_list.xml
-activity_group_members.xml
-activity_group.xml
-activity_main.xml
-dimens.xml

These can be found in the following folder paths:

Activity files:
app/src/main/java/com/example/payme2/ui/theme
https://github.com/shraddha510/PayMe/blob/4266cc2457dcccac7b94258e87fd951327603b8d/app/src/main/java/com/example/payme2/ui/theme

XML files:
app/src/main/res/layout
https://github.com/shraddha510/PayMe/blob/4266cc2457dcccac7b94258e87fd951327603b8d/app/src/main/res/layout

The Activity files handle the java UI and app functionality, while the XML files handle the layout and display features.
