# PayMe
Group 6 - CS 3354


Hello! This is Group 6's project for CS 3354, and here we explain our application and navigation around our GitHub repo. We have to call the folder "PayMe2" temporarily, since there were some issues with the other folder. We apologize for the descrepancy.

-User

-GroupMembersActivity

-GroupsActivity

-GroupListActivity

-activity_group_list.xml

-activity_group_members.xml

These can be found in the following folder paths:

Activity files:

The Activity files handle the java UI and app functionality, while the XML files handle the layout and display features.
